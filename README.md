üöó Read before installing!
------
To increase the probability that you have an excellent experience and chose the right branch for your car, it is recommended to read this before proceeding.

üöó Branch Definitions
------
* Shane: Includes some or all of Shane's fork abilities: https://github.com/sshane/openpilot
* DP: Includes Dragonpilot as the core. Dragonpilot has many different customization options accessible from the UI: https://github.com/dragonpilot-community/dragonpilot
* Spektor: Lane keeping assist can be activatrd indepently of adaptive cruise control. Only for Hondas before 0.8.6, Toyota support added recently.
* Honda: Honda-specific branch that utilizes the follow distance selector on the steering wheel to specific profiles. Not recommended for other cars.
* Coasting: Only works well on Hondas & GMs. Branch has the functionality to coast beyond the set speed (including downhills) instead of using the brakes.
* Devel: Branches in development. Check the commit history to see what's being worked on. No stability guarantees.
* Personal: Branches used on my own fleet of cars. No stability guarantees.

üöó Installation
------
* Some branches (especially DP) are known to not work well without a factory reset first. Failing to do so may have errors or conflicts later on. [Check this video for instructions on how to factory reset.](https://youtu.be/0MPv_hSH3hk?t=98)
* If using the Dragonpilot branch, enable "Allow Gas Pressed" in the controls settings to work with the standalone LKAS function properly.
