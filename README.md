Aragon's Openpilot Fork
------

This fork is a collection of many different features from other forks and some of my own neatly packaged together for an excellent Openpilot experience.

‚Ü™Ô∏è Lateral Features
------
* Honda: Seperate LKAS and ACC similar to how stock Honda Sensing performs, thanks to Spektor56.
* Engagement in gears other than drive, such as sport and low.
* Nudgeless assisted lane changes above 30MPH. Tune in `selfdrive/controls/lib/lateral_planner.py` on line 126.

‚Ü©Ô∏è Longitudinal Features
------
* No disengagement when gas is pressed.
* Honda: Custom follow distances. Use the distance button on the steering wheel to cycle through the bars while cruise is engaged.
* Honda: Custom braking profiles. Earlier braking in stop-and-go traffic as well as highway profiles. Tune in `selfdrive/controls/lib/long_mpc.py`.
* (Coasting branch only): Coast over the set speed, then use the regular brakes after meeting a certain threshold. Standard is 10MPH, edit in `selfdrive/controls/lib/longitudinal_planner.py` on line 22. 
* Comma pedal adjustments. For Hondas, this means stock logic of increments of +1MPH and holding for +5MPH.
* Comma pedal tuning. Less jerky from a stop but accelerates faster later on.

üöó General Features
------
* DevUI thanks to wirelessnet2.
* Alerts have mostly been rewritten. Better grammar and more details on specific events. Some sounds like torque alerts have been muted.
* Update prompt forcing an internet connection to check for updates has been disabled.
* Reduced the potentional for false driving model lagging alerts.
* Tesla warning sound effect under specific situations.
